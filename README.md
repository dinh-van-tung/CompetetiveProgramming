# CompetetiveProgramming
I am a competitive programming enthusiast who practices algorithms regularly. Most of my code is personalized (e.g., #define for, pair, etc.) to optimize speed during contests. Therefore, to read my code effectively, please take time to understand the #define macros before diving into the algorithm. Thank you!
